        <p>The gallery contains live examples of all the different displayer types supported in Dashbuilder. The node
            "Dashboards" contains also a set of examples of how to combine several displayers into full featured
            end user dashboards.

        <p>All the examples are built using the Dashbuilder's GWT Displayer API. If you're interested in the internals
        or just want to see how the source code looks then take a look at the following
